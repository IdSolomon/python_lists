# In Python, we call the location of an element in a list its index.

# Here's a list of Redpillers from The Matrix.
# If you must know, a "redpill" refers to a human that is aware of the true nature
# of the Matrix.

redPill = ["Trinity", "Morpheus", "Neo", "Cypher", "Mouse", "Apoc", "Switch"]

# I'm going to select a single element from the list by using square brackets --

print(redPill[3])

# Here's the same list, only this time Bane has been added.

redPill = ["Trinity", "Morpheus", "Neo", "Cypher", "Mouse", "Apoc", "Switch", "Bane"]

# I use the brackets to select the 8th redpill.
# Or the 7th index and save it to a variable.

agentSmith = redPill[7]
print(agentSmith)

# I'm not telling you why I saved Bane to agentSmith.
# Just watch the movie The Matrix Reloaded to find out!
